# Asset API Azure deployment

The template creates `asset-api` in the existing `alive-env`, enables Dapr
with app id `asset-api`, creates a private Blob container, and assigns its
dedicated pull identity ACR pull, plus its system identity container-scoped
Blob contributor and account-scoped Blob delegator roles. No Container Apps ingress is created;
gateway and owner services invoke it through Dapr.
It also allows only the ACA subnet (`172.16.66.0/23`) to reach clamd at
`172.16.65.5:3310`.

## One-time production cutover

The existing `asset` login becomes the DML-only runtime role. Migrations use
`asset_migrate` through a manual Container Apps job. Runtime and migration
database URLs are stored in separate RBAC Key Vaults.

1. Build an image containing both binaries and resolve its digest:

   ```sh
   az acr build -r alive -t alive/asset-api:bootstrap .
   digest="$(az acr repository show -n alive --image alive/asset-api:bootstrap --query digest -o tsv)"
   image="alive.azurecr.io/alive/asset-api@${digest}"
   ```

2. Review and create only the vaults, identities, role assignments, storage
   policy, and ClamAV NSG rules. This does not touch the running app:

   ```sh
   az deployment group what-if -g alive -f infra/main.bicep \
     -p storageAccountName=alivestoragebb99ee6e runtimeImage="$image" migrationImage="$image" \
        deployRuntime=false deployMigrationJob=false provisionPermissions=true
   az deployment group create -g alive -f infra/main.bicep \
     -p storageAccountName=alivestoragebb99ee6e runtimeImage="$image" migrationImage="$image" \
        deployRuntime=false deployMigrationJob=false provisionPermissions=true
   ```

3. Create the migration role, transfer schema ownership, restrict the runtime
   role, and write both vault secrets:

   ```sh
   ./scripts/bootstrap-migration-role.sh
   ```

4. Review and create the migration job without touching the runtime:

   ```sh
   az deployment group what-if -g alive -f infra/main.bicep \
     -p storageAccountName=alivestoragebb99ee6e runtimeImage="$image" migrationImage="$image" \
        deployRuntime=false deployMigrationJob=true provisionPermissions=false
   az deployment group create -g alive -f infra/main.bicep \
     -p storageAccountName=alivestoragebb99ee6e runtimeImage="$image" migrationImage="$image" \
        deployRuntime=false deployMigrationJob=true provisionPermissions=false
   ```

5. Trigger the manual GitHub `Production Release` workflow from `main` with
   confirmation `deploy-asset-api-production`. It runs migrations before
   replacing the runtime and rolls back only the runtime image on failure.

6. Confirm ingress remains disabled, Dapr app id is `asset-api`, the app is
   ready through Dapr, and ACA can reach current ClamAV signatures at
   `172.16.65.5:3310`.

The template explicitly disables Defender for Storage; ClamAV is the only
malware scanner. `ASSET_ALLOW_DEV_CALLER_HEADER` remains false in Azure.
The live PostgreSQL server allows 50 connections. Production uses
`DB_MAX_OPEN_CONNS=4`; at three replicas asset-api consumes at most 12 and
leaves 38 for other services, migrations, and operations.

The template also preserves the live Container App inactive-revision limit,
Consumption workload profile, disabled Blob soft-delete policy, default
encryption scope, and the complete disabled Defender settings. Review the full
`what-if` before deployment; only the intended application and pool changes
should remain.

## Storage hardening gate

The current storage account may have consumers outside asset-api. Audit them
before disabling Shared Key. Once asset-api is the only confirmed owner and a
clean upload/download succeeds with managed identity:

```sh
az storage account update -g alive -n alivestoragebb99ee6e --allow-shared-key-access false
```

Do not change the storage firewall to default-deny until a private endpoint or
equivalent ACA subnet path has been deployed and verified.
The live account currently reports `minimumTlsVersion=TLS1_0`; raise it to
`TLS1_2` only after the shared-account consumer audit confirms compatibility.
